** Occur do what I mean
   
+ Push region or symbol at point to regexp-history so that occur will set the
  default regexp as what's been pushed.
+ The hydra has to be summoned with a prefix body key and any one head
  key. But I want the hydra summoned immediately I call =occur=. So advice
  occur to summon the hydra by performing =hydra-?-occur-next=.
