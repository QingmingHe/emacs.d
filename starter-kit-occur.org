* Starter Kit Occur

** Occur do what I mean

+ Push region or symbol at point to regexp-history so that occur will set the
  default regexp as what's been pushed.
+ The hydra has to be summoned with a prefix body key and any one head
  key. But I want the hydra summoned immediately I call =occur=. So advice
  occur to summon the hydra by performing =hydra-?-occur-next=.
+ It's better recenter window after goto or display occur. Just do a little
  hack by =defadvice=.

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(defun occur-dwim ()
  (interactive)
  (let (thing)
    (setq thing
          (if (region-active-p)
              (buffer-substring-no-properties
               (region-beginning)
               (region-end))
            (thing-at-point-no-properties 'symbol)))

** Key bindings

Use hydra to set key bindings for that help message will be shown in
minibuffer.

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(defvar hydra-occur
  '(("j" occur-next "next")
    ("k" occur-prev "previous")
    ("d" occur-mode-display-occurrence "display")
    ("o" occur-mode-goto-occurrence-other-window "goto"))
  "A hydra for `occur'.")

(hydra-create "?"
  hydra-occur
  occur-mode-map)

(define-key occur-mode-map (kbd "j") 'occur-next)
(define-key occur-mode-map (kbd "k") 'occur-prev)
(define-key occur-mode-map (kbd "d") 'occur-display-dwim)

** Helm occur
