** Key bindings

Use hydra to set key bindings for that help message will be shown in
minibuffer.

    ("k" occur-prev "previous")
    ("d" occur-mode-display-occurrence "display")
    ("o" occur-mode-goto-occurrence-other-window "goto"))
  "A hydra for `occur'.")

** Occur do what I mean

+ Push region or symbol at point to regexp-history so that occur will set the
  default regexp as what's been pushed.
+ The hydra has to be summoned with a prefix body key and any one head
  key. But I want the hydra summoned immediately I call =occur=. So advice
  occur to summon the hydra by performing =hydra-?-occur-next=.
