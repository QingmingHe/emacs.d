* Starter Kit Evil

Evil is an evil mode to imitate Vim in Emacs. Starter Kit will set global evil
mode if starter-kit-evil is activated.

** Evil leader

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
Evil Leader provides the /leader/ feature from Vim that provides an easy way
to bind keys under a variable prefix key. For an experienced Emacs User it is
nothing more than a convoluted key map, but for a Evil user coming from Vim it
means an easier start. The default escape is *\*.
#+END_QUOTE
 
You should enable global-evil-leader-mode before you enable evil-mode,
otherwise evil-leader won't be enabled in initial buffers (*scratch*,
*Messages*, ...)
#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
(require 'evil-leader)
(global-evil-leader-mode)
#+END_SRC

** Evil mode

Set evil mode globally for that the author is a severe Vim user for the past
several years.
#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
(require 'evil)
(evil-mode 1)
#+END_SRC

** Go to change

It is so happy to key in *g;* to go to last change and g, to com back.
#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
(require 'goto-chg)
#+END_SRC

** Surround
This package emulates surround.vim by Tim Pope. The functionality is wrapped
into a minor mode.

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
(require 'surround)
#+END_SRC

To activate it, *M-x surround-mode*.

*** Add surrounding

You can surround in visual-state with s<textobject><trigger> or in
normal-state with ys<textobject><trigger>.

*** Change surrounding

You can change a surrounding with cs<old-trigger><new-trigger>.

*** Delete surrounding

You can delete a surrounding with ds<trigger>.

** Set Vim like Key Bindings
