* Starter Kit Evil

Evil is an evil mode to imitate Vim in Emacs. Starter Kit will set global evil
mode if starter-kit-evil is activated.

** Evil leader

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
Evil Leader provides the /leader/ feature from Vim that provides an easy way
to bind keys under a variable prefix key. For an experienced Emacs User it is
nothing more than a convoluted key map, but for a Evil user coming from Vim it
means an easier start. The default escape is */*.
#+END_QUOTE
 
You should enable global-evil-leader-mode before you enable evil-mode,
otherwise evil-leader won't be enabled in initial buffers (*scratch*,
*Messages*, ...)
#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
(require 'evil-leader)
(global-evil-leader-mode)
#+END_SRC

** Evil mode

Set evil mode globally for that the author is a severe Vim user for the past
several years.
#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
(require 'evil)
(evil-mode 1)
#+END_SRC

** Go to change

It is so happy to key in *g;* to go to last change and g, to com back.
#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
(require 'goto-chg)
#+END_SRC

** Set Vim like Key Bindings
