** Customary Customization

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
To edit LaTeX documents, you will probably want to include the following in
your ~/.emacs.

** PDF preview

To use Evince for PDF preview, you should activate PDF mode. To activate
inverse search, activate ... mode, though the author never succeed.

*Notes* that:
+ Just *C-c C-c*, *View* and finally *Evince* to preview.
+ The forward search is enabled by locating the page index of PDF file.
+ Evince is activated in full screen, *M-space* to show tool bar and *M-<F4>*
  to close in Windows.

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
(setq TeX-PDF-mode t)
(add-hook 'LaTeX-mode-hook 'TeX-source-correlate-mode)
(setq TeX-source-correlate-start-server t)
(setq TeX-view-program-list '(("Evince" "evince -f --page-index=%(outpage) %o")))
(setq TeX-view-program-selection '((output-pdf "Evince")))

*** XeLaTeX

XeLaTeX prevails over other LaTeX compilers for that it could use system
fonts, which is very convenient for languages such as *Chinese*. To enable
source highlight packages such as [[http://www.minted.com/][minted]] and [[http://www.ctan.org/pkg/listings][listings]] *--shell-escape* should
be added to compilation command. To enable inverse search (in theory it
works), add *--syntex=1*. To compile TeX file, just key in *C-c C-c* and
*XeLaTeX*.

*** other modes

company for completion, along with yas minor mode. Flyspell for checking
spelling. LaTeX-math-mode and cdlatex-mode for easy math. Reftex-mode to
handle references.

** RefTeX

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
RefTEX is a specialized package for support of labels, references, citations,
and the indices in LATEX. RefTEX wraps itself round four LATEX macros: \label,
\ref, \cite, and \index. Using these macros usually requires looking up
different parts of the document and searching through BibTEX database
files. RefTEX automates these time-consuming tasks almost entirely. It also
provides functions to display the structure of a document and to move around
in this structure quickly.
#+END_QUOTE

*Note* that the default bib file is fixed and he who use it should modify the
 path.
