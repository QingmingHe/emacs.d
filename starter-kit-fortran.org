* Starter Kit Fortran

Fortran is a major language for scientific computation but a minor for other.

** Fortran interface

Interfaces are heavily used since Fortran 90 and Emacs provide a minor mode
for browsing these interfaces easily.

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
(require 'f90-interface-browser)
#+END_SRC

** Completion and folding

Use company and outline just as other languages.

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
(add-hook 'f90-mode-hook '(lambda () 
                               (company-mode)
                               (flyspell-prog-mode)
                               (outline-minor-mode)
                               (setq outline-regexp " *\\(function \\|subroutine \\|type ::\\|module \\|interface \\|program \\|recursive \\)")
                               (hide-body)
                          ))
