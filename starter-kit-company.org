* Starter Kit Company
** Basic setup

Activate company for coding:

(add-hook 'cmake-mode-hook 'company-mode)
(add-hook 'inferior-python-mode-hook 'company-mode)

** Key bindings

#+begin_src emacs-lisp

** Company backends

Set the default backends for all modes.
#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp

                   ;; buffer" and "keywords" or likewise and is smarter than
                   ;; the `company-dabbrev-code' backend. To complete words in
