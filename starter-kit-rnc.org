** What is rnc
#+BEGIN_QUOTE
RELAX NG is a simple schema language for XML, based on [RELAX] and [TREX]. A
RELAX NG schema specifies a pattern for the structure and content of an XML
document. A RELAX NG schema thus identifies a class of XML documents
consisting of those documents that match the pattern.

Two syntaxes have been defined for RELAX NG. The original syntax uses XML;
with this syntax an RELAX NG schema is itself an XML document. Subsequently, a
compact non-XML syntax has been defined.
#+END_QUOTE

The compact format file has a "rnc" suffix and rnc-mode provide a major mode
for these files.
