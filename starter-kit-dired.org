** How dired presents
#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
(setq dired-listing-switches "-lah1v --group-directories-first")
#+END_SRC

- l: Is the only mandatory one.
- a: Means to list invisible files.
- G: Don't show group information. These days, when there are more laptops
  than people, the group info is rarely useful.
- h: Human readable sizes, such as M for mebibytes.
- 1v: Affects the sorting of digits, hopefully in a positive way.
- --group-directories-first: self-explanatory, I like to have the directories
  on the top, separate from the files.

** Tips
*** key bindings
- *w* copies file name to ring. *C-u 0 w* copies full path.
- *!* run shell command, *&* run shell command synchronously.
