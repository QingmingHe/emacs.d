* Starter Kit Version Control
** Git and Magit

+ Use Ido with Magit.
+ Setting the full path for Git makes Magit a little bit faster.
#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(setq magit-completing-read-function 'magit-ido-completing-read)
(setq magit-git-executable (executable-find "git"))
#+end_src

*** Resolve merge confliction
Use [[help:magit-ediff][magit-ediff]] *e* on un-merged item.

*** Git checkout single file
Use [[help:magit-discard-item][magit-discard-item]] *k* on item.

** Disable version control in Emacs

I almost never use version control system bundled with Emacs and it always
slows down Emacs. Disable it completely.
#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(setq vc-handled-backends nil)
#+end_src

** Disable backup files

I always handles my project and important files through Git so there is no
need for backup files.
#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(setq make-backup-files nil)
#+end_src

** Compare current buffer and its auto save file

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(defun ediff-buffer-with-auto-save ()
  "Find and display differences between current buffer and its auto save
file."
  (interactive)
  (let ((auto-save-file-name
         (make-auto-save-file-name)))
    (if (file-exists-p auto-save-file-name)
        (ediff-buffers (current-buffer)
                       (find-file-noselect (make-auto-save-file-name)))
      (user-error "Current buffer has no auto save file!"))))
#+end_src

To compare current buffer with its associated file, use
[[help:diff-buffer-with-file][diff-buffer-with-file]].
