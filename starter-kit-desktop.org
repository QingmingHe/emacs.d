* Starter Kit Desktop

Desktop will load, at startup, the buffers you were editing when you last quit
Emacs.

Set the file to save desktop variables and load desktop.
#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp 
(setq desktop-path (list
                    starter-kit-dir)
      desktop-dirname starter-kit-dir
      desktop-base-file-name ".emacs-desktop")
(desktop-read)
#+END_SRC

Then set variables to save.
