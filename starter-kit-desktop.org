* Starter Kit Desktop
  :PROPERTIES:
  :TANGLE:   no
  :END:

Desktop will load, at startup, the buffers you were editing when you last quit
Emacs.

+ Set the file to save desktop variables and load desktop.
+ Save no buffer and file.
+ Set variables (list) along with max length to save.
+ Delete duplicates before save.

Some variables such as [[elisp:(describe-variable 'comint-input-ring)][comint-input-ring]] is buffer local so that can't be
saved globally.

* Starter Kit History

[[help:savehist][savehist]] is much lighter than [[help:desktop][desktop]]. You should take care of this plugin for
that when file of =.savehist= grows too big, the memory consumed by Emacs will
also grows extraordinary.
