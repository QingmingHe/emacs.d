#+BEGIN_QUOTE
w3m is a text-based web browser as well as a pager like `more' or `less'. With
w3m you can browse web pages through a terminal emulator window (xterm, rxvt
or something like that). Moreover, w3m can be used as a text formatting tool
which typesets HTML into plain text.
#+END_QUOTE

Svn version of Emacs w3m does not work and the author combined several
versions to make it work, without any rational.
