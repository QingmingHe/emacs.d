* Starter Kit Flycheck
  
Don't always check buffer, it's too slow.
#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
(require 'flycheck)
(setq flycheck-check-syntax-automatically '(save mode-enabled))
(setq flycheck-gfortran-language-standard "f2008")
#+END_SRC

** Fortran
   
Check all warnings.
#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
(setq flycheck-gfortran-warnings "all")
#+END_SRC

You may work on a large project and has complex dependencies, where module
files may locate here and there. In these cases, gfortran can't find these
module files and flycheck will always prompt errors like *No such file or
directory*. The solution is to add a *.dir-locals.el* at current path and add
codes:
#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp :tangle no
(
 (f90-mode (flycheck-gfortran-include-path . ("path0" "other/path")))
 )
#+END_SRC
