reStructuredText is an easy-to-read, what-you-see-is-what-you-get plaintext
markup syntax and parser system. It is useful for in-line program
documentation (such as Python docstrings), for quickly creating simple web
pages, and for standalone documents. reStructuredText is designed for
extensibility for specific application domains. The reStructuredText parser is
a component of Docutils. reStructuredText is a revision and reinterpretation
of the StructuredText and Setext lightweight markup systems.
