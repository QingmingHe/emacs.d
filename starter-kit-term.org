** Eshell
[[http://www.emacswiki.org/emacs/CategoryEshell][Eshell]] is a great shell.

*** Configurations

#+end_src

The =eshell= directory holds alias definitions and history
information.  It is much like a =.bashrc= file for those who are
familiar with bash.  This set the value of =eshell-directory-name= to
point to the =eshell= directory in this directory.  The =alias= file
is pre-populated with some generally applicable aliases.

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
  (setq eshell-directory-name
        (expand-file-name "./" (expand-file-name "eshell" starter-kit-dir)))
#+end_src

*** Eldoc

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(defadvice eldoc-current-symbol (around eldoc-current-symbol-a activate)
  ad-do-it
  (when (and (not ad-return-value)
             (eq major-mode 'eshell-mode))
    (save-excursion
      (goto-char eshell-last-output-end)
      (let ((esym (eshell-find-alias-function (current-word)))
            (sym (intern-soft (current-word))))
        (setq ad-return-value (or esym sym))))))
(defun eshell-turn-on-eldoc ()
  (eldoc-mode 1))
(add-hook 'eshell-mode-hook 'eshell-turn-on-eldoc)
#+end_src

*** Tips
**** Multiple eshells
You can create eshell by just *M-x eshell*, or if can run *C-u 2 M-x eshell*
to create a eshell numbered 2. If eshell 2 already exists, you will switch to
it. If *M-x* is bound to *helm-M-x*, run *M-x C-u 2 eshell* instead.

**** Alias

The difference between shell alias and eshell alias is that there should not
be a *=* between alias name and command. Because eshell alias is a compiled
lisp function =eshell/alias= which defines an ALIAS using DEFINITION (two
variables). So define *la* like this:
#+begin_src sh
alias ll 'ls -la $*'
#+end_src

You can also define alias with some variables given:
#+begin_src sh
alias clean-white-spaces 'clean-white-spaces $1 t'
#+end_src

To delete an alias:
#+begin_src sh
alias some-alias
#+end_src

**** Combine Eshell with Helm

Use eshell command on each file marked in =helm-find-files=. Command should
accept one file as argument. Aliases ended with "\\(\\$1\\|\\$\\*\\)$" can be
completed by helm.

** Term
*** Multi eshell

Use =multi-eshell= to handle multiple shells. Use *\-mn* to create new shell or
switch to anther existing shell. Shell doesn't support zsh well, so specify
shell file name to be bash. Don't add =--login= to explicit-bash-args, or
shell will run at =~/= path with the =default-directory= to be that of
previous buffer. This will make path completion problematic.
#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(define-key shell-mode-map (kbd "C-p") 'helm-comint-input-ring)
(setq explicit-shell-file-name "/usr/bin/bash")
(setq explicit-bash-args '("--noediting" "-i"))
#+end_src

*** Term and ansi-term

In most cases, shell is in my favour. Only when I want to run another app
inside emacs, I will resort to to awkward term or ansi-term.

You can key in command in char mode and copy/paste in line mode. The follow
function and kbd provide easy toggling.

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
(defun my-toggle-term-line-char-mode ()
  "Toggle term between line mode and char mode"
  (interactive)
  (if (term-in-line-mode)
      (progn
        (message "Switch to char mode!")
        (term-char-mode))
    (progn
      (message "Switch to line mode")
      (term-line-mode))))

(add-hook 'term-mode-hook
          (lambda ()
            (define-key term-mode-map (kbd "C-c C-j") 'my-toggle-term-line-char-mode)
            (define-key term-raw-map (kbd "C-c C-j") 'my-toggle-term-line-char-mode)))
#+END_SRC
