** Super TAB

I want to use =TAB= for these things:
1. Trigger auto complete. This can be realised by using intrinsic
   =ac-set-trigger-key=.
2. Expand common part of all candidates if possible. This can be realised by
   =ac-expand-common= function which will try to expand common part when
   =ac-dwim= is nil.
3. Refresh candidates menu after I've typed in new characters. =ac-update=
   Just do this kind of thing.
4. If auto complete is not alive, fall back to
   [[help:yas-next-field-or-maybe-expand][yas-next-field-or-maybe-expand]] if [[help:yas-next-field-or-maybe-expand][yas-next-field-or-maybe-expand]], otherwise
   just [[help:indent-according-to-mode][indent-according-to-mode]].

*** ac-c-headers

ac-c-headers provide an ac-source for header files and header symbols
completion. Problem with ac-c-headers is it never updates symbols of a
header. So I write a function to update the symbols of a header after saving.
#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(defun my-update-c-headers-symbols ()
  "Update ac-c-headers--symbols-cache for headers that match current buffer."
  (mapc
   (lambda (h)
     (when (string-match-p
            (concat (file-name-nondirectory (buffer-file-name)) "\\'")
            (car h))
       (remove-alist 'ac-c-headers--symbols-cache (car h))
       (ac-c-headers--symbols-update (car h))))
   ac-c-headers--symbols-cache))

(defun my-add-c-h-to-hook ()
  "Add my-update-c-headers-symbols to after-save-hook if is header file."
  (let ((fname (buffer-file-name)))
    (when (and
           fname
           (derived-mode-p 'c-mode 'c++-mode)
           (string-match-p "\\.\\(h\\|hpp\\)\\'" fname))
      (add-hook 'after-save-hook 'my-update-c-headers-symbols nil t))))

(add-hook 'c-mode-hook 'my-add-c-h-to-hook)
(add-hook 'c++-mode-hook 'my-add-c-h-to-hook)
#+end_src

*** cc-search-directories

cc-search-directories are used by find-file.el to find corresponding header of
current source file and ac-c-header to determine where to search the header
files.
#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(setq cc-search-directories '("." "/usr/include"))
(when (file-exists-p "/usr/local/include")
  (add-to-list 'cc-search-directories "/usr/local/include"))
(when (file-exists-p "/opt/include")
  (add-to-list 'cc-search-directories "/opt/include"))
#+end_src

*** ac-clang-flags

ac-clang-flags are extra flags used by ac-source-clang passed to clang to
accomplish completion. Typically include paths. For C, current path is
adequate for most of the cases. For C++, path of standard libraries should be
added.

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(when (featurep 'auto-complete-clang)
  (add-hook 'c++-mode-hook 'add-c++-include-paths-general)
  (add-hook 'c-mode-hook 'add-c-include-paths-general))

(defun add-c-include-paths-general ()
  (setq-local ac-clang-flags (prj/c-include-paths-general "c")))

(defun add-c++-include-paths-general ()
  (setq-local ac-clang-flags (prj/c-include-paths-general "c++")))
#+end_src

*** ac-sources

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(defun my-c-c++-ac-setup ()
  (when (derived-mode-p 'c-mode 'c++-mode)
    (when (featurep 'auto-complete-etags)
      (add-to-list 'ac-sources 'ac-source-etags))
    (when (featurep 'auto-complete-gtags)
      (add-to-list 'ac-sources 'ac-source-gtags))
    (when (featurep 'auto-complete-clang)
      (add-to-list 'ac-sources 'ac-source-clang))
    (setq ac-sources
          (append
           ac-sources
           '(ac-source-c-headers
             ac-source-c-header-symbols)))))
(add-hook 'c-mode-hook 'my-c-c++-ac-setup)
(add-hook 'c++-mode-hook 'my-c-c++-ac-setup)
#+end_src

** CMake

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(when (executable-find "cmake")
  (eval-after-load "cmake-mode"
    `(progn
       (require 'auto-complete-cmake)
       (add-hook 'cmake-mode-hook
                 (lambda ()
                   (add-to-list 'ac-sources 'ac-source-cmake))))))
#+end_src

** Comment
*** Key bindings
+ After completion menu popped up, use *C-s* to search in candidates.
+ Use *C-M-n* and *C-M-p* to scroll down and up in quick help.
+ *C-M-?* to persist ac-help which may be useful when help page is too long or
  you want to get help when filling arguments of the function.

** Other completion
