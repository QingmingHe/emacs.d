#+TITLE: Emacs Starter Auto Complete
#+OPTIONS: toc:2 num:nil ^:nil

* Starter Kit AC

** Basic setup
Use the default settings of auto complete but disable auto complete by default.
#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
(require 'auto-complete)  
(require 'auto-complete-config)
(require 'auto-complete-clang)
(add-to-list 'ac-dictionary-directories "~/.emacs.d/elpa/auto-complete-20140322.321/dict")
(ac-config-default)
(setq ac-auto-start nil)
(setq ac-quick-help-delay 0.5)
#+END_SRC

For that IPython's completion does not work in Emacs and it is recommended to
activate jedi, which is based on auto complete. 

** Key bindings
Bind "M-/" to auto-complete
#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
(define-key ac-mode-map (kbd "M-/") 'auto-complete)
#+END_SRC

** Backends
   
Add include path, which can be obtained by *echo "" | g++ -v -x c++ -E -*, to
ac-clang backend.
#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
(defun get-c-include-path ()
  (with-temp-buffer
    (insert (shell-command-to-string "echo \"\" | g++ -v -x c++ -E -"))
    (goto-char (point-min))
    (search-forward "#include <...>")
    (next-line)
    (setq p1 (line-beginning-position))
    (search-forward "# 1")
    (previous-line)
    (previous-line)
    (setq p2 (line-end-position))
    (setq c-include-paths (split-string (buffer-substring-no-properties p1 p2)))
    (add-to-list 'c-include-paths ".")
    )
  )

(setq ac-clang-flags
      (mapcar (lambda (item)(concat "-I" item))
              (get-c-include-path)
              )
      )
#+END_SRC
