For that IPython's completion does not work in Emacs and it is recommended to
activate jedi, which is based on auto complete. You have to add the path
completion source manually or file/path will be troublesome to enter in
IPython terminal.

(add-hook 'auto-complete-mode-hook (lambda () (add-to-list 'ac-sources 'ac-source-filename)))
#+END_SRC
