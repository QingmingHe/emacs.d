;;; Commentary:

;; project-root.el allows the user to create rules that will identify
;; the root path of a project and then run an action based on the
;; details of the project.
;;
;; Example usage might be might be that you want a certain indentation
;; level/type for a particular project.
;;
;; once project-root-fetch has been run `project-details' will either
;; be nil if nothing was found or the project name and path in a cons
;; pair.

;; An example configuration:

;; :root-contains-files is necessary.
;; (setq project-roots
;;       `(("GPerl"
;;          :root-contains-files ("t" "lib")
;;          :filename-regex ,(regexify-ext-list '(pl pm))
;;          :on-hit (lambda (p) (message (car p))))
;;         ("Django"
;;          :root-contains-files ("manage.py")
;;          :filename-regex ,(regexify-ext-list '(py html css js))
;;          :exclude-paths ("media" "contrib"))
;;         ("SUGAR"
;;          :root-contains-files ("SUGAR-TAGS")
;;          :filename-regex ,(regexify-ext-list '(py f90 f))
;;          :exclude-paths (".git" "tests")
;;          :gfortran-include-paths ("../BUILD_DEBUG/include"))))
;;
;; This defines one project called "Generic Perl Projects" by running
;; the tests path-matches and root-contains-files. Once these tests
;; have been satisfied and a project found then (the optional) :on-hit
;; will be run.

;;; The tests:

;; :path-matches maps to `project-root-path-matches' and
;; :root-contains-files maps to `project-root-upward-find-files'. You
;; can use any amount of tests.

;;; Configuration:

;; :filename-regex should contain regular expression, which is passed
;;  to `find` to actually find files for your project.
;; :exclude-paths can contain paths to omit when searching for files.

;;; installation:

;; Put this file into your `load-path' and evaulate (require
;; 'project-root).

;;; Using yourself:

;; If you wrap a call in `with-project-root' then everything in its
;; body will execute under project root:
;;
;; (with-project-root
;;  (shell-command-to-string "pwd"))
